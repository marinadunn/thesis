# Thesis
This repository contains relevant development code and documentation for my M.S. Engineering: Data Science thesis (expected June 2023) research at UC Riverside, entitled "Classifying Galaxy Morphologies for LSST Using Bayesian Neural Networks."

## About: 
We first develop a standard deterministic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and eventually a fully probabilistic Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) model trained on a simulated mock data catalog of galaxies created from the Illustris TNG100 simulation as part of the [DeepAdversaries project](https://github.com/AleksCipri/DeepAdversaries) representing observing galaxies at various years with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), where observations at Year 1 are noisier, and Year 10 are less-noisy. We attempt to accurately classify the morphologies of these galaxies as either 'Spiral', 'Elliptical', or 'Merger.'

## Project Steps:
- Pre-processing data and Exploratory Data Analysis
- Develop deterministic Convolutional Neural Network model trained on noisy Year 1 data
- Evaluate CNN model performance on less-noisy Year 10 (expected to have poor performance)
- Perform Transfer Learning using these results, and re-test on Year 10 (should see improvement)
- Develop a fully probabilistic Bayesian Neural Network model
- Evaluate BNN model on Year 10 data

## Data
The simulated mock LSST catalog used was created from the [Illustris TNG100 simulation](https://www.illustris-project.org) as part of the [DeepAdversaries project](https://github.com/AleksCipri/DeepAdversaries), with observational noise and PSF added using the [GalSim package](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim). Both the original raw data files, as well as smaller subsets, can be accessed on the [DeepAdversaries Zenodo page](https://zenodo.org/record/5514180#.Ymb3zi-B2L2) in .npy file format. The mock image labels are one-hot encoded into 3 classes: Spiral ('0'), Elliptical ('1'), or Merger ('2â€™). Data augmentation such as rotation and horizontal/vertical flipping has already been performed for Mergers, and augmented images are already saved in data files.

Data Distribution:
* Training set: 23,487 images (10,017 Spirals, 5,705 Ellipticals, 7,765 Mergers)
* Testing set: 6,715 images (2,863 Spirals; 1,631 Ellipticals; 2,221 Mergers)
* Validation set: 3,355 images (1,432 Spirals; 815 Ellipticals; 1,108 Mergers)
* Total: 33,557 images (Splitting fraction 70% train : 20% test : 10% validation)

## Requirements
This code was developed using Python 3.10, Tensorflow-Probability 0.16.0, the base Tensorflow package tensorflow-macos version 2.9.0 and tensorflow-metal plugin 0.5.0 distributed by Apple Inc. It is recommended to create a new Python virtual environment before running this code. The file `requirements.txt` lists all the Python libraries needed to run the notebooks; they can be installed by running the command:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
